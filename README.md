PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Implementing the Caesar Cipher"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Assingment 1: Word Play 
                    task 1 - check if a character is vowel or not;
                    task 2 - replace vowels in a word with a certain 
                    character;
                    task 3 - make the phrase with the character ch 
                    (upper- or lowercase) replaced by ‘*’ if it 
                    is in an odd number location 
                    in the string (e.g. the first character has an odd number 
                    location but an even index, it is at index 0), or 
                    ‘+’ if it is in an even number location in the 
                    string (e.g. the second character has an even number 
                    location but an odd index, it is at index 1).
                    Assignment 2 - Caesar Cipher 
                    task 1 - write simple encryption by Caesar Cipher;
                    task 2 - write modified Caesar Cipher encryption, that
                    will use 2 keys (key 1 is used to encrypt every other 
                    character with the Caesar Cipher algorithm, starting with 
                    the first character, and key 2 is used to encrypt every 
                    other character, starting with the second character.)

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 2 classes: 
                           WordPlay - compile, create object of type WordPlay and 
                           start one of the following functions: 
                           "testIsVowel" for task 1; 
                           "testReplaceVowels" for task 2; 
                           "testEmphasize" for task 3;
                           and CaesarCipher - - compile, create object of type 
                           CaesarCipher and start one of the following functions:
                           "testCaesar" for task 1; 
                           "testTwoKeys" for task 2;
                           You will be required to choose one txt file for encryption.
                           You may choose from available in example files.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: you will need library: "edu.duke.FileResource" 
                   (simplified version of File function from Java)
